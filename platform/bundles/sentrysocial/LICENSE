In addition, the Studio License holders are allowed to integrate Cartalyst Software with intranet websites and public web services, develop their own products based on or containing Cartalyst Extensions. However, neither license holder nor license holder’s clients can sell Cartalyst Extensions as a sole product (with or without modification); License holder and license holder’s clients should use it fairly; we still hold all the rights for Cartalyst code, and we solely determine “fair use” of Cartalyst Software.
